# GitNoiseMaker

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Before using GitNoiseMaker, you **MUST** initialize a git repository in your folder by running `git init`. After generating the commit history, you are still responsible for pushing the repository to GitHub (or any remote) using `git push`.

GitNoiseMaker is a C program that generates a stream of git fast-import commands to simulate a history of commits over a specified date range, with random commit times and customizable commit frequency. This is useful for creating artificial commit histories for demonstration, testing, or fun.

## Features

- Generate a sequence of commits between two dates
- Specify the author and mean number of commits per day
- Output is compatible with `git fast-import`
- Fully configurable via command-line arguments

## Usage

```sh
./GitNoiseMaker <start-date> <end-date> <author> [mean-commits-per-day]
```

- `<start-date>`: Start date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `<end-date>`: End date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `<author>`: Author string in the format `"Name <email>"`
- `[mean-commits-per-day]`: (Optional) Average number of commits per day (default: 10)

### Example

```sh
./GitNoiseMaker 2022-01-01 2022-12-31 "Lucasgood5 <00000000+Lucasgood5@users.noreply.github.com>" 25
```

## Building

To build on Linux:

```sh
gcc -o GitNoiseMaker GitNoiseMaker.c -lm
```

## Using with git fast-import

You can pipe the output of GitNoiseMaker directly into `git fast-import` to create a new branch with the generated commit history:

```sh
./GitNoiseMaker 2022-01-01 2022-12-31 "Your Name <your.email@example.com>" | git fast-import
```

## GitHub Actions

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Compiles the program on Linux using GCC
- Uploads the compiled binary as an artifact
- Publishes a release with the binary when a tag starting with `v` is pushed
